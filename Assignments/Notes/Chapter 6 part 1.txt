Chapter 6
Appendix I & J

Elements of documentation:
The documentation for each constructor and method should include:
the name of the method
the return type (@return)
the parameter names and types (@param)
a description of the purpose and function of the method
a description of each parameter
a description of the value returned

class block comment, goes before class header. 
comment right before constructors
comment right before each method

important java tags:
@author		Author name(s)
@param		Parameter name and description
@return		Description of return value
@see		Cross-reference
@throws		Exception type thrown and the circumstances
@version	Version description

Methods:
Getters aka accessors first
Setters aka mutators after
everything else

Fields are private due to incapsulation, fields have to be private 
because they should not be allowed to be manipulated. 

When you import:
Do not do 
import java.util.*; because the asterisk imports all things from given
library. 

Just import each of your classes individually. 

Constructor is always required as it initializes fields. 

Code idioms:
Use iterators with collections
To iterate over a complete collection, use a for-each loop. When the
collection must be changed during iteration, use an Iterator with a 
while loop or a for loop, not an integer index.
