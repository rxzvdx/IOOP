USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The TheaterCorp class builds off three other classes entitled: 
                            Theater, Movie, and Rating. The rating class sets enum values 
                            (G, PG, R) for the movies. The movie class serves to create an
                            actual movie object. It contains two accessor methods (getTitle,
                            and getRatingString) which return the movie title and rating. 
                            Then is the theater class which contains two accessor methods 
                            (getScreens and getLocation) which return the screens showing
                            movies in that specific theater. Lastly it contains a mutator
                            method named addScreen which allows the user to add a screen 
                            to the theater to view a movie on. Lastly is the TheaterCorp
                            class which contains 5 accessor methods (getCorpName, getTheaters,
                            getMovies, listAllMovies, listAllTheaterMovies) which returns 
                            the corporation name, the theaters owned by the corp, a reference
                            to the movies which they can play on screen, lists all movies, 
                            and finally lists all movies playing in their theater(s). Finally
                            are 4 mutator methods (addTheater, addMovie, addMovie, 
                            and sellTheater). These methods allow the user to add a theater
                            to their "corporation", add a movie (either one that already
                            exists or to create a new one), and finally sell a theater or
                            remove it.
