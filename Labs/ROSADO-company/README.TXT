HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Company
AUTHORS:                    Antonio Rosado
USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The Company class creates a company with employees, their respective IDs, and 
                            for the addition and removal of the employees and their respective IDs. 
                            The class contains 4 accessor methods called, (getName, getEmployees, 
                            getTotalNumberOfEmployees, and listAllEmployees) which returns the name of
                            the company, all references to the employees and their IDs, the total number of 
                            employees, and finally lists all the employees with their IDs. Then there are
                            3 mutator methods, (addEmployee, removeEmployee, removeIds) which allows the
                            user to add an employee, remove an employee, and remove an ID if it exists.
