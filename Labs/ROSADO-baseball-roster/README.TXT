USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The Baseball Roster class creates a baseball roster with city, name, year, 
                            positions, and players. It allows the user to manipulate the contents of
                            the roster in a number of ways. It contains 13 accessor methods 
                            (getCity, getName, getYear, getPositions, getPlayers, toString, 
                            getPlayerString, formatString, findIndex, indexValid, findPlayerPosition, 
                            printRoster, and listPlayers). The "get" methods return the city, the name,
                            the year, the positions in the roster, and the players. The remaining 
                            methods help format the String in a visible manner, return the player
                            as a string, find an index based on position, check an index's validity, 
                            find a player's position, print the roster, then list the players. 
                            Lastly are two mutator methods (assignPlayerInPosition, and takePlayerOut). 
                            These methods allow the user to create a player and assign a certain 
                            position for that player, and the second method allows the user to remove
                            a given player.
