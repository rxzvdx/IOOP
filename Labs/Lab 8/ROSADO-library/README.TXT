HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Library
AUTHORS:                    Antonio Rosado
USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The Book class creates a book based on title, author, and/or callNumber 
                            to be added to a library. It contains four accessor methods which all 
                            return strings of  the author's name, book title, callNumber, and book 
                            details. There is also one mutator method setBookDetails which sets all book 
                            details based on user input for title, author, and/or call number. The 
                            genre class allows or the user to create a genre for the previous book(s) 
                            and manipulate the genre with its various methods. The 10 methods allow the 
                            user to get the genre name, get the books in the genre, get the number of 
                            books in the  genre, add books to the genre, find a genre by a callNumber, 
                            remove a genre either by callNumber or author, and list all genre's books, 
                            or all genres by a certain author. The library class builds on the other
                            two classes and serves to create a library of a variety of books with their
                            own info, and various genres. There are eight methods in the class that 
                            allow the user to get the total number of books in the library, add genres
                            to the library, remove a genre, list the genres, list all the books in the
                            library, pick the book of the week by random, and then print the book of the 
                            week.
