USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The shoppingTrip class represents a shopping list that allows the user
                            to add items to the list in a different number of ways, remove items,
                            and list them in certain ways as well. The getFoods() accessor method
                            just returns all food items in the foods object. Which is followed by
                            another accessor method called getNumberOfFoods which returns the 
                            number of foods in the list at the time it's called. Then are three
                            mutator methods which allow you to add food items in different ways. First
                            is addFood(String foodName) which allows users to add items to the
                            list by name, addFood(int index, String foodName) which does the
                            same but allows the user to specify where in the list it will appear,
                            and addFoodFirst(String foodName) which allows the user to add an item
                            by name into the list but makes it the first item in the list. There
                            are two mutator methods to remove items from the list: removeFood(int index)
                            and removeFood(String foodName). With one removing a food based on it's
                            index, and the other based on name. Lastly there are three different ways
                            to list the food items. First is listFood(int index) which lists one item
                            based on it's specific index, then listAllFoods() which just lists all 
                            foods, and listFoodMatching(String searchFood) which allows the user to 
                            search if an indicated food item exists in the list.
