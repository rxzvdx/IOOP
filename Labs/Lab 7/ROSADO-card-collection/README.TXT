AUTHORS:                    Antonio Rosado
USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The card class represents a singular sports card that creates a card based
                            on user input for the player's name and year of card. In the card class are
                            three accessor methods (getPlayer, getYear, and getDetails) which returns
                            the player, year, or both details of the card at once. The CardCollection
                            class represents a collection of multiple card objects, with an owner of
                            said collection. There are five accessor methods (getCollectorName, 
                            getCards, getNumberofCards, indexValid,and findFirstOfPlayer) which return 
                            the collector's name, all of the cards, the number of cards, if the index 
                            given by the user exists in the collection, and the first instance of a 
                            card based on a user provided player name. What follows are six more 
                            methods (addCard, removeCard, listCard, listAllCards, listByPlayer, and 
                            listByYear) which allows the user to add a card to the collection, remove 
                            one, list a certain card by index, list all cards in the collection, list 
                            card(s) by player name, or list card(s) by year.
